# AI Lecture Projects – Spring 1404  

This repository contains two main projects developed for the **Artificial Intelligence lecture (Spring 1404)** at SUT.  
Our group implemented and experimented with **Image Segmentation** (Computer Vision) and **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)** (Reinforcement Learning).

## Projects Overview  

### 1. Image Segmentation  
**Goal:** Segment objects of interest from images by assigning each pixel to a class label.  

**Key Points:**  
- Implemented classical and deep learning-based segmentation methods.  
- Preprocessing pipeline includes normalization, augmentation, and resizing.  
- Model trained on [insert dataset name here – e.g., Pascal VOC, COCO, custom dataset].  
- Evaluation metrics: IoU (Intersection over Union), Dice coefficient, Accuracy.  

**Results:**  
- Achieved [insert metric results] on the test set.  
- Visualized segmentation masks alongside original images for comparison.
